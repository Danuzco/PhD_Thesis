# Design of optimization tools for quantum information theory
## Abstract
In this thesis, we present optimization tools for different problems in quan-
tum information theory. First, we introduce an algorithm for quantum estate
estimation. The algorithm consists of orthogonal projections on intersecting
hyperplanes, which are determined by the probability distributions and the
measurement operators. We show its performance, in both runtime and fidelity,
considering realistic errors. Second, we present a technique for certifying
quantum non-locality. Given a set of bipartite measurement frequencies, this
technique finds a Bell inequality that maximizes the gap between the local
hidden variable and the quantum value of a Bell inequality. Lastly, to study
the quantum marginal problem, we introduce an operator and develop an algo-
rithm, which takes as inputs a set of quantum marginals and eigenvalues, and
outputs a density matrix, if exists, compatible with the prescribed data.
